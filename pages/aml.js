            <h4>1. Definition of Money Laundering </h4>
            <p>
                Money laundering is the process of concealing or disguising the
                existence, source, movement, destination, or illegal application
                of illicitly derived property or funds to make them appear
                legitimate. It has also been viewed as an act designed in whole
                or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source,
                ownership, or control of money to avoid the statutory
                requirement of reporting such transactions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Money Laundering typically involves three (3) independent
                stages: ❖Placement of funds; ❖ Layering of transactions to
                disguise the source, ownership, and location of the funds; and ❖
                Integration of the funds into society in the form of holdings
                that appear legitimate
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Anti-Money Laundering Laws (AML) is a collection of policies,
                laws, and rules intended to prevent or criminalize the practice
                of making money through illegal means. In other words, AML
                refers to the entire procedure, methods, laws, and programs
                implemented to address, restrain, and deter money laundering
                activities.{" "}
